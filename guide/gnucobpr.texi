@comment ** SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS WHEN RUNNING "MAKEINFO":                   **
@comment ** --------------------------------------------------------------- **
@comment ** Use the command "makeinfo --no-split gnucobpr.texi" to build    **
@comment ** an INFO file from this source.                                  **
@comment **                                                                 **
@comment ** Unfortunately, every version of MAKEINFO the author has tried   **
@comment ** produces a corrupted TAG TABLE at the end of the INFO file,     **
@comment ** making it impossible to gain access to nodes past the first     **
@comment ** several chapters.  If, however, you manually edit the generated **
@comment ** INFO file and DELETE the entire TAG TABLE from the end of the   **
@comment ** file (including the "Tag Table" and "End Tag Table" lines) the  **
@comment ** INFO file will be fine.  It will take a little longer for an    **
@comment ** INFO reader to locate a node (a millisecond or two) but the     **
@comment ** extra time will be unnoticeable.                                **

@comment ** SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS WHEN RUNNING "TEXI2PDF":                   **
@comment ** --------------------------------------------------------------- **
@comment ** Use the command "texi2pdf -q -c gnucobpr-xx.texi" to build a    **
@comment ** PDF (xx="a4" or "letter")                                       **
