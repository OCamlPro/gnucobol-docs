# External Documentation of the GnuCOBOL Project

This repository is a GIT version hosted on Github of the
`external-doc` part of the SVN repository of the GnuCOBOL project.

The original part can be accessed and seen here:

https://sourceforge.net/p/gnucobol/code/HEAD/tree/external-doc/

This mirror repository is maintained by
[OCamlPro](https://ocamlpro.com) as part of its [SuperBOL Studio
Project](https://get-superbol.com).

## Contents

This repository contains mostly the texinfo files to generate four
guides on GnuCOBOL:

* gnucobpg: [GnuCOBOL Programmer's Guide](https://get-superbol.com/gnucobol/gnucobpg)
* gnucobqr: [GnuCOBOL Quick Reference](https://get-superbol.com/gnucobol/gnucobqr)
* gnucobsp: [GnuCOBOL Sample Programs](https://get-superbol.com/gnucobol/gnucobsp)
* gnucobpr: GnuCOBOL Programmer's Reference (not yet available)

The links above are generated for Sphinx by OCamlPro.

It also contains an ODT and PDF version of:

* [GnuCOBOL guide to interfacing COBOL and C](https://github.com/OCamlPro/gnucobol-docs/blob/master/GnuCOBOL_C_Interaction.pdf)

As a side note, the GnuCOBOL project also contains:

* the [GnuCOBOL Manual](https://get-superbol.com/gnucobol/manual)

in its sources, that is a very good additional source of information.
